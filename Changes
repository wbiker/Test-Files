Revision history for Perl extension Test::Files.

    - Made various refactorings to increase code reuse.
    - Changed from using Test::Differences to using Text::Diff.  This has
      two advantages:
      1. It makes it slightly easier to have the location of the error
         correctly reported when a test fails.
      2. It enables compares_dirs_ok which needs to compare lots of files
         while reporting a single error.
    - Added compare_dirs_ok which compares all files in a pair of directory,
      failing with diff diagnostics if any disagree.

    - Added dir_contains_ok which checks a directory for the presence of
      named files.
    - Added dir_only_contains_ok which makes sure that a directory has
      exactly a specified list of elements, nothing more or less.
      This is a bit awkward since you must currently list subdirectories
      explicitly, lest they show up in the list of unexpectedly seen files.
    - Corrected diagnostic output so it works like other Test:: modules.
      Previously, I had folded some error output into the test name
