Revision history for Perl extension Test::Files.

    - Corrected diagnostic output in compare_dirs* so that each missing file
      is listed on its own line.  Previously, they were juxtaposed on one
      line, including very pleasant #'s for decoration.
    - Changed Files.pm so none of the tests report timestamps.  Some OSes
      (notably Solaris) translated the timestamps, probably to deal with
      time zones.  I am explicitly deciding that timestamps do not count
      in file comparisons.  If you need to test timestamps, use -M etc.
      Remember that the person installing your module won't always be in
      your timezone.
    - Corrected tests to reflect the removal of time stamps from file_ok
      output.
    - Sorted the list of missing files in compare_dirs* so that I can test
      the error message (and the new vesion is neater).

    - Added compare_dirs_filter_ok which works like compare_dirs_ok, but sends
      each line of input through a caller supplied filter function first.
      This allows you to remove things like timestamps which though different
      should not count as failure.
    - Refactored to avoid code duplication in the compare_dirs* functions.
    - On advice from Schwern, converted tests to use the very nice
      Test::Builder::Tester.  This made the tests nicer and easier to work
      on, but had no affect on the Files.pm code.
    - Improved the documentation (well I think it as in improvement)

0.03  Wed Oct 15 10:02:49 CDT 2003
    - Made various refactorings to increase code reuse.
    - Changed from using Test::Differences to using Text::Diff.  This has
      two advantages:
      1. It makes it slightly easier to have the location of the error
         correctly reported when a test fails.
      2. It enables compares_dirs_ok which needs to compare lots of files
         while reporting a single error.
    - Added compare_dirs_ok which compares all files in a pair of directory,
      failing with diff diagnostics if any disagree.
    

0.02  Mon Oct 13 15:03:17 CDT 2003
    - Added dir_contains_ok which checks a directory for the presence of
      named files.
    - Added dir_only_contains_ok which makes sure that a directory has
      exactly a specified list of elements, nothing more or less.
      This is a bit awkward since you must currently list subdirectories
      explicitly, lest they show up in the list of unexpectedly seen files.
    - Corrected diagnostic output so it works like other Test:: modules.
      Previously, I had folded some error output into the test name
