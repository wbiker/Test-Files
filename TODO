Functions Schwern suggested which are not implemented yet:

#-----------------------------------------------------

dir_ok( "some/dir", {
        "foo"       => "some/dir/foo would contain this",
        "bar"       => "some/dir/bar would contain this",
        "baz/biff"  => "some/dir/baz/biff would contain this"
 });
# I suggested using undef for the values here to request a check of structure
# only, that is only file names would be examined, not contents.  Yet,
# Schwern had already suggested dir_contains_ok, which is probably more
# directly intelligiable.

#-----------------------------------------------------

find_ok( "some/dir", sub { which will be run against all files in some/dir
                           and returns true if they pass } );

#-----------------------------------------------------

I suggested:

dirs_agree("dir1", "dir2")

Schwern suggested a new name for dirs_agree:

compare_dirs_ok instead of dirs_agree

(I'm extrapolating, he didn't make a direct suggestion, but his earlier
suggestions point to something like this.)
